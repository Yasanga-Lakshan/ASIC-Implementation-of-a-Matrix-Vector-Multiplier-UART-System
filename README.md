🧮 Matrix-Vector Multiplier UART System – RTL Synthesis Deliverables

This repository documents the synthesis deliverables for the `mvm_uart_system`, including schematics, synthesis reports, parameter explorations, and physical layout visualizations.

📦 Deliverables

1. Synthesized RTL Design Schematic 🔧 

- The RTL schematic was successfully synthesized and visualized using **Design Compiler (DC)** via **Design Vision**.
- The schematic represents the optimized design of the `mvm_uart_system`.


2. Synthesis Reports (Generated by DC) 📑 

a) Ports Report ⚙️ 
- Details all input and output ports of the top module, their types, and bit widths.
- Useful for integration with external IPs or top-level SoC designs.

b) Area Report 🧱 
- Total gate count and hierarchical area breakdown were generated.
- Helps understand the resource footprint of the design.

c) Power Report 🔋 
- Power analysis was performed for dynamic and leakage power using switching activity files or estimations.
- Indicates the power efficiency of the design for embedded applications.

d) Timing Report ⏱️ 
- Includes both:
  - **Cells**: List of instantiated standard cells.
  - **Timing paths**: Setup/hold analysis and critical path identification.
- These reports are essential for closing timing and meeting performance specs.


3. Parametric Synthesis Results 📊 

Synthesis was performed with varying parameter values of `R`, `C`, `W_X`, and `W_K` in the top module. The resulting **area and power consumption** were recorded. The results can be seen in the PDF document given.


4. Post-Layout Visualization (PnR) 🧱 

- The final Place and Route (PnR) layout was implemented and visualized using **IC Compiler II (ICC2).
- Includes floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis, routing, and DRC/LVS-clean layout generation.
